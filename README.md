# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game

I have made this interacive 2 player game of Tic Tac Toe using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

Rules:
  Simple really. Just like how you would play any normal game of Tic Tac Toe. X goes first, then 0 and so on. It shows on the side whose turn it is.

Features:
  There is a reset button to reset the whole game back to start. Also, I have included a cute gif of a cartoon dancing whenever a player wins.
